# Health-Score

This app is not for weight loss. It was designed to raise awareness of everyday consumption, which has proven long-term consequences. The food data frame was sourced from data.gov, and the recommendation data frame is based on US National Library of Medicine publications. Your data is not being saved by the app because it prioritizes maintaining a daily 5-minute balance over creating complex graphs.

Enjoy and stay healthy!
